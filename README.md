Applied Statistics Examples
================

Final projects of the [Specialization in Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics), which is taught online by Duke University in Coursera.

The specialization has four courses, of which I have completed three. I share in the corresponding folders the data, R code, the generated `.md` report, as well as my course certificate.
